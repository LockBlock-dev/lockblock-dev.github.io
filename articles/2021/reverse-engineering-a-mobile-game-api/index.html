                <p>
                    I was playing
                    <a
                        href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.horagames.cryptominer"

                        >Crypto Idle Miner</a
                    >, a mobile game about crypto currencies, when this question went through my
                    mind. And I think I'm not the only one who has thought of this using an app.
                </p>
                <p>It's time to get my hands dirty.</p>
                <h2 id="yes-but-how"><a href="#yes-but-how">Yes but how</a></h2>
                <p>
                    That's a good question. How on earth can I spy on this bad boy... I'm not on a
                    web browser so no "Inspect Element".
                </p>
                <p>
                    My plan was simple: doing a
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack" target="_blank"
                        >Man-in-the-middle attack</a
                    >, also called MITM, to see the requests between the app and the game server.
                    So, like any human on this planet, I went on google and casually researched:
                    <i>"MITM on Android apps"</i>. After looking at the results I found the holy
                    grail, <a href="https://mitmproxy.org" target="_blank">mitmproxy</a>.
                </p>
                <h2 id="mitmproxy"><a href="#mitmproxy">mitmproxy</a></h2>
                <p>
                    This tool makes the whole process of a MITM attack very simple by providing you
                    with the "server" side app (on your PC) and the certificate for the device to be
                    spied on. I downloaded the binaries, connected my phone to my PC, downloaded and
                    installed the certificate and finally started the game.
                </p>
                <button class="imgLink">
                    <img src="img/no_internet_error_cim.png" alt="nice error" />
                </button>
                <p>
                    No internet? Why, I'm connected to the WIFI it should work... Once again, I
                    searched on google:
                    <i>"mitmproxy no internet on apps"</i> and realized that it couldn't work. In
                    fact, since Android 7, applications don't trust user certificates for security
                    concerns, I guess. I had to find a workaround. First I looked how can I add my
                    very safe official certificate to the game and found
                    <a href="https://github.com/shroudedcode/apk-mitm" target="_blank">apk-mitm</a>.
                </p>

                    This script attempts to disable

                    and tries to allow user certificates by patching the apk code. Then it rebuilds
                    it and signs it. Simple.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I just needed the game apk: for that I tried to get the apk from the Play Store
                    and after from my phone. Both apk were patched but I couldn't install them on my
                    phone... Back to square one. I went back on mitmproxy documentation and found at
                    the bottom the
                    <a
                        href="https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/howto-install-system-trusted-ca-android"
                        target="_blank"
                        >solution</a
                    >.
                </p>
                <h2 id="android-studio"><a href="#android-studio">Android Studio</a></h2>
                <p>
                    Who would have thought I would need Android tools to get around Android's own
                    security. I followed mitmproxy guide, installed Android Studio, created a
                    android virtual device (AVD) with the naivety to think that I will be able to
                    use the Google Play Store.
                </p>
                <button class="imgLink">
                    <img src="img/android_studio_apis.png" alt="google play apis" />
                </button>
                <p>
                    In fact, Google are smart, AVDs with the Google APIs are protected so that I
                    cannot write my certificate in the system. After learning that I recreated
                    another AVD without Google APIs this time. Now that I have an Android with my
                    very safe official certificate in its system, I have to install the game but
                    without the Play Store. For this I downloaded and used
                    <a href="https://auroraoss.com" target="_blank">Aurora Store</a>. It is a great
                    alternative to Google Play in my opinion. Finally, I can now spy on this game
                    and expose all its secrets.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now that I can see everything my phone does with the internet in clear just like
                    a 3 letter agency does, let's dive into it.
                </p>
                <button class="imgLink">
                    <img src="img/mitm_preview.png" alt="mitm preview" />
                </button>
                <p>
                    Simply use the application a bit and you will see many requests to the game
                    server. There are unwanted requests from other services but let's focus on the
                    main topic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking at the URLs of these requests, it looks like we found a secret
                    undocumented API known only by the developers:
                    <code>https://terra.horahub.com/api</code>. It's time to try everything I can do
                    in the game and write down all the endpoints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the time I write, I found about twenty endpoints, but I saw on Twitter that
                    the developers were going to update their API.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    So, how does this game work? This game uses a private
                    <a
                        href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api"
                        target="_blank"
                        >REST API</a
                    >. When you start the game, it requests this API to get the common variables
                    (prices, objects, ...), the infos about researches, buildings, ... and it
                    requests your savegame. From time to time, the game saves your progress and
                    sends it to the server. And there are also endpoints for some functions in the
                    game (achievements, claiming a promo code, ...)
                </p>
                <p>
                    After writing all endpoints, I worked on a JavaScrypt library to interact with
                    this specific API and published it as a NPM package. If you are interested,
